                            <h2>About Us:</h2>
                                <p>We, here at Dean Fam Co, are doing out best to maintain your trust by constantly learning and improving to give you the best products possible. As a business we are grateful for your support and trust. </p>

                                <p>Luk has been working for the BYU Prototyping Lab since 2019 (1 1/2 years). For those years Luk has been learning, loving, and perfecting 3d printing, amidst other skills. He learned that is so much more than pressing “start print”. From the first layer to the top surface finish, Luk loves to ‘nerd out’ and perfect the process. Averaging 10-15 prints a week at BYUPL Luk has the skills and practice to ensure that you get the highest possible quality every time.</p>

                                <p>BYUPL is a campus prototyping and research machine shop that is equipped with CNC mills, routers, lathes, and 3d printers. He works with students and faculty from a variaty of backgrounds and majors, for example mechanical, manufacturing, electrical, civil, and chemical engineers and industrial designers and other various majors. Luk works to solve problems and help those in the lab to make their dream a reality.</p> 


                            <h2>Meet the Team:</h2>
                                <p>Hey! It’s the Dean’s here and we are stoked that our dreams are finally a reality. We started trying to think of ways to make a little more money after we got married in 2019. As two undergraduates with dreams of a PhD we knew we needed more than university wages! 3D printing at out home made the first appearance when we finally bought a printer!! We took a risk and supported it while it was on kickstarter. Then the pandemic hit and all our plans, school, work and life took a pause. Spending more time together helped us to decide what we truly enjoyed and could do well together!</p>
        
                                <p>Here we are now with a 3D print shop, a DIY laser in the making and a CNC router coming soon!</p>

                                <p>We regularly design and make products for our home to improve our living. For example 3D printing a ratchet belt hanger, making removable ceiling fans for our apartment, making a desktop for our sit stand desk, and printing drawer organizers for the kitchen. This gives us practice of knowing how to model, optimize design, and make DIY classy! </p>

                            <h3>Hey guys I’m Luk! (Not a typo) </h3> 

                                <p>I am super excited that we finally made it! I am studying Mechanical Engineering at BYU for my undergrad then will be perusing a masters in mechanical engineering and finally a PhD in Engineering Education so I can help inspire the next generation of engineers. When I was younger I loved working with my hands and using my mind to figure things out. I got my first Kinex (like Legos) when I was 6.  I still couldn’t read all the directions. Still I opened the box and looked at all the pieces and the pictures and made the project all by myself! </p>
        
                                <p>Since then, I have know that Mechanical Engineering was the place for me. I found my love for machining and 3D printing at the BYU Prototyping Lab in 2019. A neighbor of ours talked me into looking around the shop and learn more about machining, eventually leading to me getting a position as a lab assistant. I had never seen or heard of most of the machines in the shop. Learning the difference between an endmill and bit, FDM and SLA opened my eyes to the hard work and beauty of machining and fabrication. Now this is what I think of from morning to night.</p>

                            <h3>Hi I’m Ali</h3> 

                                <p>I am currently an undergraduate at BYU in Family Studies with an emphasis in CFLE, Certified Family Life Educator. I am passionate about the importance of families and working to make our families better. As a CFLE I want to teach others about the tools and skills they can develop to make the super hard burdens surrounding family life easier to understand. And the crazy playtimes more about making memories than cleaning up the mess afterward!</p>

                                <p>We are expecting our little baby girl in June and are so excited! </p>

                                <p>With that excitement comes worries and fears too because we are jumping into something that we have never done before, parenting. This little one is going to be a college campus babe that comes to work, classes, study halls, and devotionals with Mom and Dad for the first year of their life. I am so thankful for Luk and his love and support to make sure that both baby and I are feeling well. Each morning begins with Luk giving me a kiss and telling me he loves me. Then in one swift motion he is bent over my growing belly holding our little girl and telling them how excited he is to meet them and how loved they are! My heart soars each time because he is going to make a great Dad!!</p>
